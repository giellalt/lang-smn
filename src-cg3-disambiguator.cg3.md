## Sets containing sets of lists and tags

This part of the file lists a large number of sets based partly upon the tags defined above, and 
partly upon lexemes drawn from the lexicon.
See the sourcefile itself to inspect the sets, what follows here is an overview of the set types.

### Sets for Single-word sets

OKTA and go, and the set INITIAL for initial letters 
go
INITIAL

### Sets for word or not

WORD
WORD-NOT-de
NOT-COMMA

### Derivational affixes

DER-V

DER-N

DER-A1
DER-A

A-V

A-NOT-V

### Case sets

ADLVCASE

CASE-HALFAGREEMENT
CASE-AGREEMENT
CASE

NOT-NOM
NOT-GEN
NOT-ACC

### Verb sets

NOT-V

### Sets for finiteness and mood

REAL-NEG

MOOD-V

GC

VFIN

VFIN-POS

VFIN-NOT-IMPRT

VFIN-NOT-NEG

NOT-PRFPRC

### Sets for person

SG1-V
SG2-V
SG3-V
DU1-V
DU2-V
DU3-V
PL1-V
PL2-V
PL3-V

### Sets consisting of forms of "leđe" (these ones need to be rewritten)

### Pronoun sets

### Adjectival sets and their complements

### Adverbial sets and their complements

### Sets for coordinators

### Sets for adverbs that have lookalikes
Here come some adverbs that have identical twins in other POS. 
If these are found in Adv contexts, we treat them as adverbs.

### Sets of elements with common syntactic behaviour

### Sets for verbs

V is all readings with a V tag in them, REAL-V should
be the ones without an N tag following the V.  
The REAL-V set thus awaits a fix to the preprocess V ... N bug.

* The set COPULAS is for predicative constructions

TRANS-V is the set for verbs really taking objects

* Sets for verbs choosing oblique objects or adverbials
* **STVLIST** is the list of strictly transitive verbs. In the rules, refer not to STVLIST, but to the set STV defined below.

STRICT-TRANS-V is the set for verbs which don't let a GenAcc be a modifier of anything else than an object, e.g. Mun organiseren eatni gievkkanis. - eatni wants to be the object

### Valency sets

* **PLACE-V** Those get only not locative if the target is a member TOOL, ABSTR-TOOL or ANIMATE or CONCEPT. Selects more locatives than ONLY-PLACE-LOC-V 

### Adverb sets

### Adjective sets

### NP sets defined according to their morphosyntactic features

### The PRE-NP-HEAD family of sets

These sets model noun phrases (NPs). The idea is to first define whatever can
occur in front of the head of the NP, and thereafter negate that with the
expression **WORD - premodifiers**.

The set **NOT-NPMOD** is used to find barriers between NPs.
Typical usage: ... (*1 N BARRIER NOT-NPMOD) ...
meaning: Scan to the first noun, ignoring anything that can be
part of the noun phrase of that noun (i.e., "scan to the next NP head")

### Other negatively defined morphosyntactic noun sets

### Noun sets

Nominal sets defined according to their morphophonological properties
Sets for lexeme homonymy (most of them are moved to where the actual rules are.)

The words in the set **N-PO** can be both N and Po, the set takes that into account.

### Nominal sets defined according to their semantical properties

* Spatial noun sets. These nouns behave like postpositions

* Time sets

* Amount sets

OKTA

* Sets for nouns with morpho-syntactic preferences

* Number-related sets

* Sets for case, possessive, etc.

* Sets for nouns as pred

* Sets for animals

* Sets for things

* Sets for qualities

* Sets for things, not necessarily tools

* Sets for things such that people can be inside them:

* Sets for things such that people cannot be inside them:

* Part-whole sets for human

* Sets for places

* Sets that can both be buildings/places and represent humans

* Sets denoting relations

### Miscellaneous sets

### Border sets and their complements

### Syntactic sets

*These were the set types.*

## Adjectives and adverbs

### Adv or not?
maid has many readings and as Rel it is a member of S-BOUNDARY. Therefore we need to disambiguate it early in this file. Most important is to select Adv. Because of that A and N still can have Vfin readings, it is difficult to make very general rules.

## Comitative rules

Assuming there is Sg Com / Pl Gen homonymy in Inari Saami. There is, but far more marginal than
for North Saami, the following rules should be revised to account for that.

* **Loc-v** select Sg Loc if LOC-V to the left in the clause. No mainverb to the right in the clause

### Locative and comitative - Disambiguation based upon coordination

* **GenModifiesN** is a tentative rule to be modified

## Variant lemmas

### And then we remove the verbs which didn't get any syntactic tag, in favour of verbs with syntactic tags.

* **realverbX**

* **IfonlyVerb** selects the FMAINV reading in the cohort

* **IfonlyConNeg** ConNeg if it is @-FMAINV or @-FAUXV

### **killifVinCohort** This rule removes all other readings, if there is a mapped V reading in the same cohort. Every case which this goes wrong, should be fixed in mapping rules or previous disrules.

* **X**

# Removing Err/Orth

Denne regelen fjerner Err/Orth når det er samme lemma, sjøl om morfologien er forskjellig.

* **errsub** removes err/orth forms

Test: Go for minimal weight.

# Substitute rules

These 12 substitute rules add the <smn> language code to all words, to govern 
their behaviour in the subsequent cg files. The rules are removed when this
file is ported to Apertium.
