      <h1>Inari Sámi</h1>
      <h2>Status quo</h2>
      <p>The work is still preliminary.</p>
      <p>The Inari Sámi parser is more a skectch than a real parser. It was built in order
         to experiment with the
         twolc and lexc for Inari Sámi.
      </p>
      <p>The work was based upon the paradigms in Morottaja and Sammallahti's dictionary, and
         upon Matti
         Morottaja's <em>Anarâškielâ ravvuuh</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>In addition to that, there is now a short grammar available, <em>Kielâoppâ, Inarinsaamenkielen
            kielioppi</em>, by Marja-Liisa Olthuis. It has more paradigms than the dictionary, but unfortunately
         it does
         not have a large morphophonological part (morphographemical would actually be most
         needed).
      </p>
      <h2>TODO</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>The basic parser should be completed</li>
         <li>A lexicon should be added (the dictionary)</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Rationale, plans</h2>
      <p>A parser such as the one sketched here is valuable in itself, as a way of investigating
         Inari Sámi
         morphophonology. In addition to that, it may be used in practical applications, such
         as interactive
         grammatical lookup and intelligent dictionaries, spell checkers, etc.
