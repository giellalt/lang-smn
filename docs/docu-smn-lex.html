Documentation of the \*-lex.txt files
=====================================

The smn-lex.txt file
--------------------

Some basic lexica for nouns and verbs have been added.

The nouns
---------

The file contain a handful of nouns. They are divided into these lexica:

### Even-syllable stem

The continuation lexica follow the stem system. The setup is not
finished, I am not convinced that the division set up in the dictionary
is the optimal one for lexc.

-   **SOLLA :**  
    Ã¢-, u- and i-stems
-   **LUCCA:**  
    As SOLLA, but with vowel lenghtening.
-   **KIETA:**  
    As SOLLA, but splits Nom strong, and Ess, Par stronger.
-   **KUSSA:**  
    still pointing to SOLLA.
-   **KUOSA:**  
    still pointing to KIETA.

### Odd-syllable stems

-   **LITTER:**  
    No CG, no 2nd syll vowel alternation
-   **JIEREEH:**  
    No CG, but 2nd syll vowel is shortened
-   **IMMEEL:**  
    No CG, but 2nd syll vowel is shortened or lowered
-   **KOLGOOH:**  
    No CG, but 2nd syll vowel is facultatively shortened
-   **UAIVAT:**  
    No CG, but 2nd syll vowel is facultatively lenghtened

The adjectives
--------------

This is still just a dummy file, with no adjectives added.

The verbs
---------

The copula and negation verb are added, otherwise it is still only a
dummy file.

The closed classes
------------------

Generating the closed classes typically involves less morphophonology.
Since it is idiosyncratic anyway, it does not refer (much) to the
twol-smn.txt file. The closed-smn-lex.txt file now contains personal,
demonstrative, reflexive and interrogative pronouns.

Adpositions
-----------

Dummy file.
