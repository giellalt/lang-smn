      <title>Documentation of the twol-smn.txt file</title>
      <p>This file is written in the Koskenniemi-style twolc format. Given the frequent many-to-many-alternations in Inari S치 grammar, it would probably be better to write it in xfst.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, the rule set is still preliminary.</p>
      <section id="Alphabet_and_sets" >
        <title>Alphabet and sets</title>
        <p>The parser uses Latin 1 plus digraphs c1 d1 n1 s1 t1 z1 for the S치 letters, as in Northern S치mi. In addition, some morphographemes (h2, b3, etc) are added, this is for letter not undergoing the same changes as other h, b, etc.</p>
        <p>The X1, Q1 etc. are diacritical symbols triggering morphophonological processes such as consonant gradation, etc.</p>

            <title>Deletion rule</title>
            <p>The quantitative gradation is covered by the rule &quot;Gradation: Double Consonant&quot;, deleting the second of a double consonant in WeG environments.</p>

            <p>The parser contains the following alternation rules:</p>
            <source>&quot;Qualitative Gradation of Simple Consonant&quot;
&quot;III-I Gradation&quot;
&quot;t:d1&quot;
&quot;h:v&quot;
