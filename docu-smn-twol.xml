      <title>Documentation of the twol-smn.txt file</title>

      <p>This file is written in the Koskenniemi-style twolc
      format. Given the frequent many-to-many-alternations in Inari Sá
      grammar, it would probably be better to write it in xfst.</p>
      
      <p>Needless to say, the rule set is still preliminary.</p>

      <section>
        <title>Alphabet and sets</title>

        <p>The parser uses Latin 1 plus digraphs c1 d1 n1 s1 t1 z1 for
        the Sámi letters. In addition, some morphographemes (h2, b3,
        etc) are added, this is for letters not undergoing the same
        changes as other h, b, etc.</p>

        <p>The X1, Q1 etc. are diacritical symbols triggering morphophonological processes such as consonant gradation, etc.</p>

            <title>Deletion rule</title>
            <p>The quantitative gradation is covered by the rule &quot;Gradation: Double Consonant&quot;, deleting the second of a double consonant in WeG environments.</p>

            <title>Change rules</title>
            <p>The parser contains the following alternation rules:</p>


            <source>&quot;Qualitative Gradation of Simple Consonant&quot;
&quot;III-I Gradation&quot;
&quot;t:d1&quot;
&quot;h:v&quot;
