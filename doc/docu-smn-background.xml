            <title>Status quo</title>
            <p>The work is still preliminary.</p>
            <p>The Inari Sámi parser is more a skectch than a real parser. It was built in order to experiment with the
            twolc and lexc for Inari Sámi.</p>
            <p>The work was based upon the paradigms in Morottaja and Sammallahti's dictionary, and upon Matti
            Morottaja's <em>Anarâškielâ ravvuuh</em>. </p>
            <p>In addition to that, there is now a short grammar available, <em>Kielâoppâ, Inarinsaamenkielen
            kielioppi</em>, by Marja-Liisa Olthuis. It has more paradigms than the dictionary, but unfortunately it does
            not have a large morphophonological part (morphographemical would actually be most needed).</p>

            <title>TODO</title>
            <ol>
               <li>The basic parser should be completed</li>
               <li>A lexicon should be added (the dictionary)</li>
            </ol>

         <section>
            <title>Rationale, plans</title>
            <p>A parser such as the one sketched here is valuable in itself, as a way of investigating Inari Sámi
            morphophonology. In addition to that, it may be used in practical applications, such as interactive
            grammatical lookup and intelligent dictionaries, spell checkers, etc.</p>
