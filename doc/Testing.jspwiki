!!!Testing is important, before you check in your work

!!make
With this one you check that there is no technical issues. Read the report.

!Typical issues:
* ERROR: Sublexicon is mentioned but not defined. (PYERRI)
** there is a sublexicon PYERRI, probably in a stem-file, which is not in the affixfile. 
*** a typo?
*** you are planning a new lexicon?
* ERROR: Sublexicon is mentioned but not defined. (muvgâ PUIGA)
** there is an unbreakable whitespace between muvgâ and PUIGA
* ERROR: Compilation aborted because of 1 parse error. line 11634: syntax error at "suoraan" 
** look at line 11634 in src/morphology/lexicon.lexc, but you must correct the error in the sourcefile!
* Segmentation fault: 11, Error 139
** can be e.g. > instead of %>. Look at what you have done yourself, or at the last svn-log-mail, if it is not your own work.


!! make check
!yaml-tests - they are static and tests the same lemmas every time
* yaml tests are good for testing changes in twolc and in the paradigms in lexc 

!genererated missing nouns, adjectives, verbs, propernouns
* These are dynamic tests, and tests all the lemmas in the stemfiles, also the new lemmas you just added. Testing that it is possible to generate the lemmas as base form. This test does not test the inflection, but very often the testing still reveal if a lemma has got the wrong continuation lexicon.

!! test the work
* usmn, usmnNorm – analyse the forms, e.g. nieidáin

If you don't get any analysis, only a ?, then you should generate the word:

* dsmn, dsmnNorm - generate the forms, e.g. nieidâ+N+Sg+Com

Do you have a new analyser and generator? How to check the date/time for when you analyser/generator was compiled:
* ll src/

!! Scripts as a help to look at the generated forms
When you are in langs/smn - the quick command:
{{{sh devtools/noun_minip.sh nieidâ }}}
{{{sh devtools/adj_minip.sh uánehâš }}} 
{{{sh devtools/prop_minip.sh Aanaar }}} 

Get only the correct lemma:
{{{sh devtools/noun_minip.sh '^nieidâ[:+]' }}}

Look at all lemmas going to the same continuation lexicon:
{{{sh devtools/noun_minip.sh PIIVTAS | less
sh devtools/adj_minip.sh KOOIDAS | less }}}

!! Test the miniparadigms in the stem files
Look at all forms:

{{grep '¢' src/morphology/stems/nouns.lexc | cut -d '¢' -f2 | cut -d '!' -f1 |preprocess |grep '[a-z]' |usmnNorm |less }}

Get the forms which are not recognized by the analyser:

{{grep '¢' src/morphology/stems/nouns.lexc | cut -d '¢' -f2 | cut -d '!' -f1 |preprocess |grep '[a-z]' |usmnNorm |grep '\?' | less }}

!! Help to compare the lexicons
You get a list in html (Safari) of all continuation lexicons with example words.

When you are in langs/smn

* sh devtools/generate-noun-wordforms.sh
* sh devtools/generate-adj-wordforms.sh
* sh devtools/generate-verb-wordforms.sh
* sh devtools/generate-prop-wordforms.sh
