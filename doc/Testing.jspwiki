!!!Testing is important, before you check in your work

!!make
With this one you check that there is no technical issues. Read the report.

!Typical issues:
* ERROR: Sublexicon is mentioned but not defined. (PYERRI)
** there is a sublexicon PYERRI, probably in a stem-file, which is not in the affixfile. 
*** a typo?
*** you are planning a new lexicon?
* ERROR: Sublexicon is mentioned but not defined. (muvgâ PUIGA)
** there is an unbreakable whitespace between muvgâ and PUIGA
* ERROR: Compilation aborted because of 1 parse error. line 11634: syntax error at "suoraan" 
** look at line 11634 in src/morphology/lexicon.lexc, but you must correct the error in the sourcefile!


!! make check
!yaml-tests - they are static and tests the same lemma every time
* yaml tests are good for testing changes in twolc and in the paradigms in lexc 

!genererated missing nouns, adjectives, verbs, propernouns
* These are dynamic tests, and tests that the words you added are possible to generate as base form

!! test the work
* usmn, usmnNorm – analyse the forms, e.g. nieidáin
* dsmn, dsmnNorm - generate the forms, e.g. nieidâ+N+Sg+Com

Do you have a new analyser and generator? How to check the date/time:
* ll src/

!! Test the miniparadigms in the stem files
Look at all forms:
