!!!Testing is important, before you check in your work

!!make
With this one you check that there is no technical issues. Read the report.

!Typical issues:
* ERROR: Sublexicon is mentioned but not defined. (PYERRI)
** there is a sublexicon PYERRI, probably in a stem-file, which is not in the affixfile. 
*** a typo?
*** you are planning a new lexicon?
* ERROR: Sublexicon is mentioned but not defined. (muvgâ PUIGA)
** there is an unbreakable whitespace between muvgâ and PUIGA
* ERROR: Compilation aborted because of 1 parse error. line 11634: syntax error at "suoraan" 
** look at line 11634 in src/morphology/lexicon.lexc, but you must correct the error in the sourcefile!


!! make check
!yaml-tests - they are static and tests the same lemma every time
* yaml tests are good for testing changes in twolc and in the paradigms in lexc 

!genererated missing nouns, adjectives, verbs, propernouns
* These are dynamic tests, and tests that the words you added are possible to generate as base form

!! test the work
* usmn, usmnNorm – analyse the forms, e.g. nieidáin
* dsmn, dsmnNorm - generate the forms, e.g. nieidâ+N+Sg+Com

Do you have a new analyser and generator? How to check the date/time for when you analyser/generator was compiled:
* ll src/

!! Scripts as a help to look at the generated forms
When you are in langs/smn - the quick command:
{{{sh devtools/noun_minip.sh nieidâ }}}
{{{sh devtools/adj_minip.sh uánehâš }}}

Get only the correct lemma:
{{{sh devtools/noun_minip.sh '^nieidâ[:+]' }}}

Look at all lemmas going to the same continuation lexicon:
{{{sh devtools/noun_minip.sh PIIVTAS | less
sh devtools/adj_minip.sh KOOIDAS | less }}}

!! Test the miniparadigms in the stem files
Look at all forms:

{{grep '¢' src/morphology/stems/nouns.lexc | cut -d '¢' -f2 | cut -d '!' -f1 |preprocess |grep '[a-z]' |usmnNorm |less }}

Get the forms which are not recognized by the analyser:

{{grep '¢' src/morphology/stems/nouns.lexc | cut -d '¢' -f2 | cut -d '!' -f1 |preprocess |grep '[a-z]' |usmnNorm |grep '\?' | less }}

!! Help to compare the lexicons
You get a list in html (Safari) of all continuation lexicons with example words.

When you are in langs/smn

* sh devtools/generate-noun-wordforms.sh
* sh devtools/generate-adj-wordforms.sh
* sh devtools/generate-verb-wordforms.sh
* sh devtools/generate-prop-wordforms.sh
