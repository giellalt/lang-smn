Here are some tips for efficient testing:

!!!Using ./configure

In order to test only the analysers you want, you may get rid of the other ones,
by deleting all generated files, with the command:

{{{
make clean
}}}

Then configure the system as you want it. The following command
gives you only the analysers and generators for the dictionary 
orthography, and not the ordinary analysers:

{{{
./configure --disable-analysers --disable-generators --enable-dicts
}}}

Then compile by writing

{{{
make
}}}

Now, the command {{make check}} will give only the dictionary yaml files.


!!!Comparing the yaml reports

You may want to know exactly which yaml files are 
affected by your last file changes, and which are not. It may e.g. be
important to check whether something (and if so: what)
has become worse. The following procedure will tell you just that:

# Write ''make check'' in a __new__ terminal window.
# copy the whole output (''cmd A cmd C'') in a SubEthaEdit document
# In SubEthaEdit, select all text, press ''ctrl alt cmd P'' and type
  {{grep YAML}}
# The result is the result of all tests (see example below).
  This file may now be saved, as ''test1'', or something
# After some work, repeat the procedure, save as ''test2''
# compare the to by the command {{diff test1 test2}}

This is what the file looks like:

{{{
YAML test 1: generator-dict-gt-norm.xfst + dict-gt-yamls/N-aarran_dict-gt-norm.gen.yaml - 16/0/16 PASS
YAML test 2: generator-dict-gt-norm.xfst + dict-gt-yamls/N-caallim_dict-gt-norm.gen.yaml - 15/1/16 FAIL
YAML test 3: generator-dict-gt-norm.xfst + dict-gt-yamls/N-caskes_dict-gt-norm.gen.yaml - 13/3/16 FAIL
...
}}}

Advice: Intermediate files like test1, test2 may just be deleted. If you
want to save them for reference, give them a date, and save them in the
{{misc}} folder. There they will be invisible to the {{svn status}}Â command.
