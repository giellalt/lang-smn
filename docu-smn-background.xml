        <title>Status quo</title>
        <p>The work is still preliminary.</p>
        <p>The Inari Sámi parser is more a skectch than a real parser. It was built in order to experiment with the twolc and lexc for Inari Sámi.</p>
        <p>The work was based upon the paradigms in Morottaja and Sammallahti's dictionary. In addition to that, there is now a short grammar available, <em>Kielâoppâ, Inarinsaamenkielen kielioppi</em>, by Marja-Liisa Olthuis. It has more paradigms than the dictionary, but unfortunately it does not have a large morphophonological part (morphographemical would actually be most needed).</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The basic parser should be completed</li>
          <li>Given the complexity of inari Sámi morphophonology, the morphophonological rule component should be rewritten in xfst, rather than in twolc.</li>
          <li>A lexicon should be added (the dictionary)</li>

        <title>Rationale, plans</title>
        <p>A parser such as the one sketched here is valuable in itself, as a way of investigating Inari Sámi morphophonology. In addition to that, it may be used in practical applications, such as interactive grammatical lookup and intelligent dictionaries, spell checkers, etc.</p>
